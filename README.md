# Modular URL Shortener & Telemetry Pipeline

A high-performance Single Page Application (SPA) URL Shortener built with React, Vite, and Material UI. The application features an automatic batch-generation workspace, client-side route redirection analytics, and an integrated real-time logging telemetry pipeline that connects directly to the central campus evaluation engine.

---

## 🏗️ Project Architecture

The workspace is organized into two primary components:
* `notification-app-fe/` - The main front-end workspace built with React and Vite, running explicitly on Port `3000`.
* `logging-middleware/` - The asynchronous telemetry logging module that standardizes and pushes system health metrics.
